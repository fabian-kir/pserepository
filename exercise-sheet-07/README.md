# About
This repository contains the classes needed for solving excercise sheet 7.

The sheet has a presence and a homework part.

In the presence part you work with mutable and immutable objects.
In the homework part you work with primitives and exceptions.

The code should be solved in the specific classes.
In the presence part you have to use the class you created and in the homework part you have to use the `LazyHamsterGameApp`-class to run your code.
